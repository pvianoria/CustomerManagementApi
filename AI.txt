Task 1: Generate Comprehensive Documentation

a) A concise, well-structured README file explaining the project documentation
	To generate the ReadMe file I used the following statement:
	Please, generate a concise, well-structured README.txt file explaining the CustomersController class
	After the first request a second request was added:
	Add to the ReadME.txt file documentation regarding AppDbContext, Customer and program classes
	The file was included inside the project 'CustomerManagementApi\CustomerManagementApi.csproj'
b) Comments for classes, methods, and properties
	To generate the comments I used the following statement:
	Please, add comments for classes, methods, and properties for the various classes inside the project 'CustomerManagementApi\CustomerManagementApi.csproj'
	After the first request a second request was added:
	Please, do the same in the file Program.cs
	The updated files replaced the original ones
c) API endpoint documentation describing parameters, responses, and examples
	To generate the API endpoint documentation I used the following statement:
	Please, generate API endpoint documentation for the CustomersController class inside the project 'CustomerManagementApi\CustomerManagementApi.csproj' in a file named API-documentation.txt, describing parameters, responses, and examples
	The generated documentation was included inside the API-documentation.txt file

•	Review the generated documentation for accuracy and completeness
The generated README.txt, API-documentation.txt, and the comments added to the classes, methods, and properties were reviewed for accuracy and completeness. The documentation accurately reflects the functionality of the CustomersController class, AppDbContext, Customer model, and Program class. The API endpoint documentation provides clear descriptions of parameters, responses, and examples for each endpoint. The comments in the code enhance understanding of the purpose and functionality of each component. Overall, the documentation is comprehensive and well-structured.

•	Ask Copilot to generate example usage code for complex APIs
	To generate example usage code for complex APIs I used the following statement:
	Please, generate a new console application project named CustomerManagementApi.Client containing example usage code for the CustomersController class inside the project 'CustomerManagementApi\CustomerManagementApi.csproj'
	The generated example usage code was reviewed and found to be accurate and helpful for understanding how to interact with the CustomersController API endpoints.
	It was added to the solution 'CustomerManagementApi.sln'.
